# MP6---Dijkstras-Algorithm...Shortest-Path-Problems

[PLEASE SEE mp6.pdf FILE FOR FULL INSTRUCTIONS AND EXPLANATION!](mp6.pdf)

The goal of this machine problem is to implement a module for Dijkstra’s algorithm, and to apply the module to solve a variety of shortest path graph problems.

Use a layered design to develop a clean interface to a module that implements Dijkstra’s algorithm. You must design and document your interface, clearly defining the required inputs, data structures, and output for the module. You must also design test drivers and implement the user interface as described below. In addition to submitting all source code you must also submit a makefile that compiles all code and creates an executable with the name “lab6”. Your code must have not compiler warnings and no memory leaks or other valgrind errors.

Two additional documents should be submitted. One is a test plan that describes details of your implementation and demonstrates, with a test script, how you verified that the code works correctly. The verification should include detailed prints from your program to show that you program operates correctly. The second document describes your performance evaluation, and the details are described below.
